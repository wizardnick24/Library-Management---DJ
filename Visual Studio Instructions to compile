1️⃣ Install Required Software
✅ Install Visual Studio Build Tools

Download:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Select:

✔ Desktop development with C++

✔ MSVC v143 (or latest)

✔ Windows 10/11 SDK

You do NOT need the full Visual Studio IDE.

✅ Install Visual Studio Code

https://code.visualstudio.com/

✅ Install VS Code Extensions

In VS Code → Extensions:

C/C++ (Microsoft)

C/C++ Extension Pack (optional)

2️⃣ Open Developer Command Prompt

⚠️ This step is mandatory

From Start Menu:

Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022


This sets all compiler paths correctly.

3️⃣ Launch VS Code From That Prompt
code .


This ensures cl.exe works inside VS Code’s terminal.

4️⃣ Create Your C++ File

Example:

dedupe.cpp


Paste the program inside and save.

5️⃣ Compile (MSVC)
Basic compile (no external libraries)
cl /std:c++17 dedupe.cpp

Compile with TagLib
cl /std:c++17 dedupe.cpp ^
/I C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include ^
/link /LIBPATH:C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib tag.lib

Compile with libFLAC
cl /std:c++17 flac_to_wav.cpp ^
/I C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include ^
/link /LIBPATH:C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\lib flac.lib

6️⃣ Run the Program
dedupe.exe

7️⃣ Common Errors & Fixes
❌ 'cl' is not recognized

You did not open the Developer Command Prompt.

❌ cannot open include file: taglib/fileref.h

TagLib not installed

Wrong vcpkg path

Verify:

dir C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include\taglib

❌ LNK1104: cannot open file 'tag.lib'

You forgot:

/link /LIBPATH:...

OPTION B: MinGW + VS Code (Alternative)

Only use this if you cannot use MSVC.

1️⃣ Install MinGW-w64

https://www.mingw-w64.org/

Select:

Architecture: x86_64

Threads: posix

Exception: seh

Add bin folder to PATH.

2️⃣ Compile
g++ -std=gnu++17 dedupe.cpp -ltag -o dedupe.exe


or

g++ -std=gnu++17 flac_to_wav.cpp -lFLAC -o flac_to_wav.exe

3️⃣ Run
./dedupe.exe

OPTIONAL: One-Click Build Task in VS Code

Create .vscode/tasks.json:

{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Build C++ (MSVC)",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "cl",
      "args": ["/std:c++17", "dedupe.cpp"],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    }
  ]
}


Press:

Ctrl + Shift + B

Best Practices (Strongly Recommended)

Always test on a small folder first

Add a dry-run mode before destructive scripts

Keep backups until you verify results

If you want:

VS Code debugging setup (launch.json)

vcpkg auto-integration

A unified build script for all tools you’ve built

Say the word and I’ll wire it cleanly.
